          As a second-year student, I am looking for opportunities that will allow me to further discover my strengths and weaknesses. I have a decent background in Data Structure and Algorithm, which I consider my most notable edge. However, I don’t want to rely too much on one area to compete with other candidates in the race for good positions in big corporations. I understand that a capable developer must have a broad range of knowledge in most parts of the IT industry, going as far as knowing how a computer works with ones and zeros, even when that information may not directly help improve their performance in their current job. Through this course, I want to build up on those foundations, even when the course may include lessons that I’ve already learned at school. Although Korean is not a language that I find myself comfortable with, I have heard from numerous sources including members in my family that Korea is a market hungry for skillful programmers and most importantly the amount of potential income can be really significant compared to domestic jobs. My goal is to create my first personal projects using the diverse set of skills that I will be able to acquire in the course, and also get an internship in a Korean company.   '''))
